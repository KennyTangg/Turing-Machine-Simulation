# Turing Machine Simulation
This is my first project using java. This project is made to help me understand the syntax and structure of the Java programming language. The project contains 2 java files : 
- A Java only implementation
- A JavaFX version 

### *TuringMachine.java*

This is a Java implementation of a Turing Machine that can process input strings and determine their acceptance based on predefined transition rules. The implementation includes two example languages:

1. **Language A** : Accepts palindromes (strings that read the same forward and backward).
2. **Language B** : Accepts strings of the form 1^n0^n (equal number of 1s followed by 0s).

### *Simulation.java*

This class is a visual simulation of a Turing Machine built with Java and JavaFX. It shows how a Turing machine processes an input tape through a set of transition rules, updating its state and tape symbols step-by-step.

In this Simulation, I use Language B which accepts strings of the form 1^n0^n (equal number of 1s followed by 0s) as the language for this turing machine.


**Prerequisites:**
 - Java Development Kit (JDK)
 - JavaFX SDK
